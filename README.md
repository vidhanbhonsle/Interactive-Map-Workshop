## Introduction

In this workshop we will learn how to create an interactive map using JS and REST APIs from the HERE Location Suite.

## Prerequisites
An IDE or text editor - Notepad, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [atom](https://atom.io/)

## Expected Outcome
An HTML page which shows a map when opened in a browser.

## Steps
#### Step 1 : Setup VS code
#### Step 2 : Render a Map and place a marker on our current position with a custom image
#### Step 3 : search for all hospitals around us and place markers on them
#### Step 4 : We use isoline routing to find the EV charging stations actually closest to us.
#### Beyond : Final code with visual customizations.
